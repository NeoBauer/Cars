1. Created std::unique_ptr for engines in electric and petrol car;

3. Made function to to take away unique_ptr with engine "pullOutPetrolEngine()" when speed = 0;
4. Made getters to Electric and Petrol engines data "getElectricEngineData()", getPetrolEngineData(), they are returning raw ptr
5. Made accelerate() virtual function
